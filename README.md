"Quick Fire Maths" for OS X by ColonBracket. 

#Please note:
In case you are having a bit of a dilemma with the naming, ColonBracket was originally named Delta Developers Team when it was founded, which is why you will notice that the older versions of our software still have the "Delta" logo on them.
